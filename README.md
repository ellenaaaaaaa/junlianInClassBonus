# Project Description

### Problem (paragraph 1) – Clearly describe the problem the project addresses
The local ice cream shop has a long line during the summer- the prime season for ice cream shop vendors. The wait time discourages quite a few customers, who decide to leave instead of standing in line. This decreases the amount of sales the ice cream shop vendor can make, this also demotivates repeat customers as the wait time is high.   

### Solution (paragraph 2) – Propose a solution to the identified problem
Creating an online ordering system that customers can access on mobile allows customers to browse the menu, tailor their order and pay in advance. In this way, a customer can just pick up their order and avoid waiting in line. Another way this saves time is by reducing the number of orders and order payments that the employee at the counter processes- which saves the ice cream shop time on gathering order details and processing payments.    


### Technologies (paragraph 3) – List the technologies required to implement the solution
